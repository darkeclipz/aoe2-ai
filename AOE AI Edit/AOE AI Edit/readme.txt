AI Editor is a Windows application for creating and editing Age of
Empires (AoE) and AoE Expansion, or Rise of Rome (RoR) AI (artificial
intelligence) files. 

AI files are basically text files with extension .ai. By modifying them
you can create new computer player strategies. They can be included in
scenarios, and this generally makes scenarios a greater challenge and
more fun to play. The game does not include any utility for editing such
files - the text editor is supposed to be the one. But if you have tried
it with the text editor, you know it is not the easiest job. So I
decided to write a little utility to fill the gap.

This version of AI Editor implements a number of new features, such as
support for RoR AI files, support for games, support for civilizations,
overall AI status and listing of invalid items, status bar, clipboard 
support, editing of comments, and viewing statistics.

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY of any kind, so USE IT
AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

INSTALLATION

The original package is a ZIP archive called aiedit20.zip, which contains 
the following files:

aiedit.exe 	AI Editor executable
aiedit.doc	AI Editor documentation (MS Word document)
objects.xls	Reference information about AoE objects (MS Excel sheet) 
stratsmp.ai	A sample AoE AI file released by Ensemble Studios
readme.txt	This README file

Unzip the archive in a folder of your own choice, for example C:\Program
Files\aiedit. After unzipping, create a shortcut to the executable
aiedit.exe in your Start menu or on your desktop.

For more information about AI Editor, refer to the file aiedit.doc.
This is a 20-page manual about AI Editor. It also inclides a guide
on editing AI files.

If you still have questions, please email me. I will also appreciate
if you send me any AI files of your own created with AI Edior that 
represent successful strategies.

Enjoy!
