; 1. Need more wood on early Castle Age and probably even while advancing to
;    Castle Age if I don't have enough wood for a siege workshop.  I must press
;    the attack on those Imperial Age strategy AIs early in the Castle Age to
;    keep them off balance.  I cannot afford to sit around waiting on a 
;    battering ram while they boom and go Imperial.
; 2. After all infantry technologies are researched in the Imperial Age, go 
;    ahead and build up to 4 barracks and up to 2 archery ranges.
; 3. Take Goth research to get Huskarls at barracks if super archer offense
;    detected.  Wait till advancing to Imperial Age.  Otherwise wait till all
;    other infantry researches are completed.
; 4. First assault is now starting maybe too late.  Step back on military
;    strength required but put a minimum military population of 10 on the rule.
;    A late flush is not as effective as an early flush.

;There are two large advantages to defining constants.  One is that it makes
;the script easier to read.  The other is that it makes the script easier to
;modify.  Let's settle in on some conventions.  All goal numbers will be 
;preceded by "g-", all goal values will be preceded by "gv-".  All regular
;constants will not be preceded by either.

; Military Superiority Rules
;
;******************************************************************************
;
; This can also be done with a goal, but I prefer using an obsolete 
; strategic number instead because it allows for comparisons.  For example,
; if my military superiority is greater than some value do this, if it is less
; than that value do that.  You can do the same thing with goals by nesting
; a bunch of "or" statements.  I just find it much easier to do with an 
; obsolete strategic number.

;  Redefine strategic number 215 - Degree of military superiority.
;
;        -2 = There is an enemy that has at least 20 more military than I do.
;        -1 = There is an enemy that has at least 10 more military than I do.
;         0 = Every enemy is within 10 of my military.
;         1 = I have over 195 military or 10 more than every enemy.
;         2 = I have over 200 military or 20 more than every enemy.

(load "Training4/TSA366")

;What you will find in this file are several rules that look like this:

;(defrule

;   (not(enemy-buildings-in-town))
;   (goal g-tsa gv-on)

;Now this is the whole idea of the TSA - to increase your town size so that
;your military will "defend" against the enemy buildings in your town.
;
;Following up on a post by Vader, I combined my TSA rules with my building
;rules to build a nice, tight, easily defendable town.  If I fire off my build
;rule at a small town size and allow the TSA rules to increment the town size
;till the building can be placed, I will have a nice, tight town.

;******************************************************************************

;******************************************************************************
;
;  I copied these rules from Mabuse.  I added the TSA portion to them.
;
;  Town-under-attack seems to be
;  one of those facts evaluated once per rule pass.  It will still think it is
;  under attack for one rule pass past turning the TSA off.  This will falsely
;  set a high enemy-sighted-response-distance and your military will rush off
;  to fight everything they see at or closer to that distance.

;Even a fast castle building AI will not have its castle up within 20 minutes,

;the castle builder on the head!

;Only Teutons will get a castle and murder holes before the 22 minute mark, so
